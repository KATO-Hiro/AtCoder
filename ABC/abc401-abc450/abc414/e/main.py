def floor_decomposition(number):
    """
    count = floor(number / pos), left < pos <= right

    Returns a list of tuples (count, left, right) where:
        - count is the number of times the number can be divided by right
        - left is the next lower number that can be divided by count
        - right is the current divisor

    The process continues until right becomes zero.

    Landau's O(âˆšn) algorithm is used to decompose the number.
